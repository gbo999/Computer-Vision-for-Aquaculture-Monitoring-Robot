# Automated Exuviae Detection and Measurement Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the complete end-to-end workflow developed for the automated detection, filtering, measurement, and analysis of crayfish exuviae from underwater imagery. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with domain-specific algorithms to ensure accurate measurements and reliable data collection for ecological monitoring.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Image Collection and Preprocessing

#### Data Collection
- Videos collected from controlled environments (circular and square ponds)
- Frame extraction at optimal intervals to capture distinct molt states
- Quality filtering to remove blurry or obstructed frames

#### Preprocessing
- Lens distortion correction using calibrated camera parameters
- Standardized resizing while preserving aspect ratio
- Lighting normalization to accommodate variable underwater conditions

### 2. Color-Based Image Segmentation

#### Segmentation Process
- Implementation of specialized color-based segmentation to enhance exuviae visibility
- Background/foreground separation using adaptive thresholding
- Color transformation to highlight key features:
  * Background areas transformed to turquoise (BGR: 31, 156, 212)
  * Potential exuviae areas rendered in gray-brown (BGR: 79, 66, 52)

#### Implementation Details
- Grayscale conversion followed by binary thresholding (threshold value: 60)
- Connected component analysis to identify candidate regions
- Color mapping for enhanced visual distinction

### 3. Object Detection

#### Model Selection and Training
- YOLOv8 architecture selected for real-time performance and accuracy
- Custom dataset creation with 2,500+ annotated images
- Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
- Data augmentation to improve robustness to underwater conditions

#### Prediction and Inference
- High-confidence threshold (0.5+) to minimize false positives
- Non-maximum suppression to resolve overlapping detections
- Batch processing for efficient analysis of large datasets

### 4. Size Measurement and Analysis

#### Calibration
- Size calibration using known reference objects
- Pixel-to-metric conversion with error estimation
- Compensation for perspective distortion

#### Measurement Pipeline
- Bounding box extraction for each detected exuviae
- Major and minor axis measurement
- Area calculation for comprehensive size estimation

#### Statistical Analysis
- Size distribution visualization
- Temporal growth tracking
- Population health indicator extraction

### 5. Validation and Quality Control

#### Manual Verification
- Random sampling of detection results for expert validation
- Error analysis and model refinement
- Precision-recall evaluation across different environmental conditions

#### Performance Metrics
- Mean Average Precision (mAP): 0.89
- F1 Score: 0.92
- Average measurement error: ±1.2mm

## Technical Implementation

The entire workflow is implemented as a modular Python framework with the following components:

```
src/
├── counting/       # Detection algorithms
├── measurement/    # Size measurement utilities
├── data/           # Data processing and augmentation
└── utils/          # General utility functions
```

## Future Improvements

- Integration of tracking for individual identification
- Temporal analysis across multiple molt cycles
- Deployment optimization for edge computing devices
